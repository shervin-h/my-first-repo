# Sample Project for learning git
first make directory for php project and run `git init` command
then folder `.git` creat in root dir.
I practice below commands,
for initial git
> git init
after run this command, all files, directories and subdirectories, are tracked.
then creat project files such as index.html
> git status
show we still not add any file in stash or stage
